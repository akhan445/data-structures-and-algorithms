# Data Structures and Algorithms

I've created this resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about data structures and algorithms, especially for tech interviews. You'll find the relevant files in their respective folders. 

### Introduction

We use **data structures** for storing data. There are 2 types of data strucures, linear and non-linear data structures. Linear data structures are where the data is stored in a sequential manner such as arrays, linked lists, and stacks. For non-linear structures they are organized in the opposite manner such as trees and graphs.

Computers cannot think for themselves and require a human to tell them what to do. This is usually done by providing a set of tasks which form a program. Programming are written using programming languages which translate the code we write into machine code that the computer can understand. So a program is really just a bunch of tasks bunched together.

Any task that we have can be broken down into a set of instructions. These set of instructions represent **algorithm**. An algorithm is language agnostic and is what we use to help us measure the efficiency of the code we are writing.

An example of an algorithm could be organizing a deck of cards by suit. We have clubs, hearts, spades and diamonds and we want to organize them into 4 piles. We go through each card, identify the suit and put it in the right pile. After we finish going through the entire deck, we have an organized deck by suit.

We use BIG O notation to help us analyze an algorithm or code to help us determine if it is written in an optimized way. Understanding Big O helps us identify key concepts providing us with a toolkit to help us become better programmers.
